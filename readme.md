## Laravel framework with store-locator

This is a project I completed when working at a large company with over 50 outlets across Victoria.

The project was a complete website redesign using the Laravel PHP framework using Composer and Bower, LESS, Twitter Bootstrap, Grunt and Node.

The site includes a Javascript store-locator, using geolocation and the user's address to display a map of the nearest outlet within the specified radius.
